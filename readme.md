# Der Stream

A private project which I started in order to learn about the apache big data stack (kafka, hadoop/storm, spark (especially graphx)). 
Goals:
1) Stream tweets 
2) Filter for hashtag (e.g. all SP500 companies)
3) Map-reduce activity of hashtags
4) Construct a network where hashtags are nodes and correlations are links
