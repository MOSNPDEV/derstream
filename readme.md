# Der Stream
A private project which I started in order to learn about the apache big data stack. 

Currently implemented:
1) Stream tweets with kafka
2) Filter for some objectif (currently most frequently used english adjectives).
3) Simple analysis

Further goals:
4) Collect more data and perform analysis
5) Use Spark to process data
6) Implement some kind of Sentiment Analysis (e.g. correlation between word usage in tweets related to hashtags relevant to economy).
